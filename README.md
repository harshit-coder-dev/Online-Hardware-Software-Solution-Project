<p> Learn Concept of DAO pattern how to implements in Design </p>

<h2>Responsibilities<h2>

<h4>To create user undestable Application where All functionalities proper work with Mysql query where sorting filtering and manupualtiong a any table data very easy.And connnectinng jdbc to Mysql for more dynamic maintain Relationship between all tables.</h4>

<h1>All Steps Are as Follows: </h1>

Step 1: Creating a required Database.
	
	
	Create a database sb101_project;
	use sb101_project;


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step2: Create a All reruired tables:



	1. create HOD table
	(
	username varchar(15),
	password varchar(15)
	);
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	2.create table engineer
	  (
	  EngId primary key auto increment,
	  EngName varchar(15),
	  EngUserName varchar(15) unique,
	  EngPasswor varchar(15),
	  EngCategory varchar(20)
	  );

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	3.create table Problems
	(
	pid int primary key auto_increment,
	pname varchar(20),
	pcategory varchar(15)
	);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	  **Relation between enployee and engineer and problems;

          4.create table employee_engineer
   	  (
  	   rpid int,
   	  reid int,
   	  FOREIGN KEY (rpid) REFERENCES problems(pid),
  	   FOREIGN KEY (reid) REFERENCES engineer (Engid)
   	  );

 </div>


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Create a Separated Unitily package fro making a database connection...

	1. DButil
	
	Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
		
        String url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sb101_project";

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Create a Bean Classes

	1. Hod.
	2. Engineer.
	3. Employee.
	4. EmployeePro.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Create a DAO Interfaces and its Implementation class.

	1. HodDao (I).
	   HodDaoImpl (C).

	2. EngineerDao (I).
	   EngineerDaoImpl (C).

	3. EmployeeDao (I).
	   EmployeeDaoImpl (C).

        4. ProblemsDao (I).
	   ProblemsDaoImpl (C).
	

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Create a Separated Exception classes.

	1. HodException (C).
	

	2. EngineerException (C).
	 

	3. EmployeeException (C).
	  

        4. ProblemsException (C).
	


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: Create a Separated use cases classes.

	I. Use Cases for HOD...	

	1. use Cases for HOD:
	   **HodLoginUseCase...

	   a. username : admin.
	   b. password : admin123..

	2. Register a new Engineer with a username(email) and password and the category (Hardware/software)
	   **RegisterEngineerUseCase1
	   **Query:  PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement("insert into Employee(engName,engUserName,engPassword) values(?,?,?)");

	   a. username (email) : HODchoice
	   b. password         : HODchoice
	   
	3.Can see a List of all the Registered Engineers.
	   **AllEngineeerDetailsUseCase
	   **Query:  PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement("select * from engineer");
	
        4.Can Delete any Engineers from the system
	   **DeleteEnginnerUseCase
	   **Query: PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("delete from Engineer where engname = ?");
	
	5.Can able to see all the raised problems.
	   **	
	   **Query:PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement("select * from problems");
			 
	
	6.Can assign any problem to any Engineer.
           **AssignProblemToEngineerUseCase
	   **Query: PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement("select * from engineer where engid=?");
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	II. Use Cases for Engineer...	

	1.Each engineer has an account by which they can log in. (credentials given by the HOD)
	***EngineerLoginUseCase
	Query :PreparedStatement ps =conn.prepareStatement("select * from Employee where empUserName=? AND empPassword=?");
		 

	2.Engineer can view the problem assigned to him by HOD.
	***GetEngineerToAssignProblem
	Query : PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement("select e.engid,p.pid, e.engname,p.pname,e.engcategory,p.status from engineer e INNER JOIN problems p INNER JOIN employee_engineer ee ON e.engid=ee.reid AND p.pid=ee.rpid AND p.pname =?;");
		
		
	3.Engineer can update the status of the problem addressed by him. i. e. whether it is solved or anything.
	***UpdateProblemStatusUseCase.
	Query :PreparedStatement ps= conn.prepareStatement("update problems set status = ? where pid= ?");
			 
		
	
	4.They can see a list of all the problems attended by him/her.
	***GetListOfEmployeeAssignProblemUseCase.
	Query : PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement("select e.engid, e.engname,e.engcategory,p.pname from engineer e INNER JOIN problems p INNER JOIN employee_engineer ee ON e.engid=ee.reid AND p.pid=ee.rpid AND p.pname=?");
			
		
		
	5.Engineer can change his password.
	***UpdatePasswordToEngineerUseCase
	Query :PreparedStatement ps= conn.prepareStatement("update Engineer set Engpassword= ? where EngUserName= ? AND EngPassword= ? ");			
		 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	II. Use Cases for Engineer...	


	1.Employee can register himself with his username and password.
	***RegisterEmployeeUseCase1
	***Query :PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement("insert into Employee(empName,empUserName,empPassword) values(?,?,?)");
	

	2.Each employee has their account in the system with which they can log in
	***EmployeeLoginUseCase
	***Query :PreparedStatement ps =conn.prepareStatement("select * from Employee where empUserName=? AND empPassword=?");
		
	
	3.Employee can register any complaint (hardware/software) through the system. After registering the complaint a complaint id is generated by the system.
	***CreateProblemUseCase
	***Query :PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement("insert into Problems(pname,pcategory)values(?,?)");
		
	
	4.Employees can see the status of their problem by using complaint id. Status means they can check who (engineer) is assigned to his problem.
	***UpdateProblemStatusUseCase
	***Query :PreparedStatement ps=	conn.prepareStatement("select * from problems");
		

	5.They can see all complaints history raised by him/her.
	***GetEngineerToAssignProblem
	***Query :PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement("select e.engid,p.pid, e.engname,p.pname,e.engcategory,p.status from engineer e INNER JOIN problems p INNER JOIN employee_engineer ee ON e.engid=ee.reid AND p.pid=ee.rpid AND p.pname =?;");
		

	6.Employee can change his/her password.
	***AllProblemListUseCase
	***Query :PreparedStatement ps= conn.prepareStatement("update employee set emppassword= ? where empUserName= ? AND empPassword= ? ");
